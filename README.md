## Description

**Parental Control** is a smart contract-based parental permission system designed to control and log all financial transactions initiated by children. This system ensures that payments can only be executed with the explicit permission of the specified owner (the parent or guardian). It provides a comprehensive solution to monitor and manage children's spending while preventing unnecessary or unauthorized payments.

Key features of this project include:

- **Smart Contracts**: Utilizes Solidity to create smart contracts that enforce parental permission for all financial transactions.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly React.js front-end interface allows parents and guardians to manage permissions, review transaction logs, and gain control over their children's spending.
- **Ethereum Integration**: Integrates with the Ethereum blockchain for secure and transparent transaction handling.
- **Bootstrap Styling**: Implements Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
- **PolyZkEVM Testnet**: Utilizes the zkEVM testnet for Ethereum contract testing, development and for Less Gas cost and faster Transaction speeds.

With Parental Control, you can maintain oversight of your child's financial activities, ensuring responsible spending and enhancing financial management within your family.

## Usage

To use the Parental Control system, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Parental Control Web Application**:
   Open a web browser and navigate to the provided URL, which is typically `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Connect the wallet and set up the users and owners of the particular funds initially**:
   - If you already set the owners and users then on connecting the wallet you can directly be routed to home page.
   - If you don't have an account, you may need to register or create one through the application.

3. **Set Up Permissions for Your Child's Account**:
   - After logging in, you should have access to a dashboard or settings page where you can set up permissions for your child's account.
   - Define the rules and conditions under which your child can request payments.

4. **Child Requests Payments**:
   - Your child can use the application to request payments for various purposes.
   - The system will ensure that these payment requests require parental approval before processing.

5. **Parental Approval**:
   - As a parent or guardian, you will receive notifications or alerts when your child requests a payment.
   - Review the payment requests and decide whether to approve or reject them through the application's interface.

6. **Payment Execution**:
   - Once you, as a parent, approve a payment request, the system will execute the payment.
   - The approved amount will be transferred to the child's account, and the transaction will be securely processed on the Ethereum blockchain.

7. **Transaction Record**:
   - All approved payments will be recorded and stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and a secure transaction history.

This process helps parents or guardians oversee and control their child's financial activities, ensuring responsible spending and financial management.
